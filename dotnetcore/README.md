# Hello Goose - Dot Net Core (Razor)

This is a Microsoft Dot Net Core application. You don't have to use Windows. Dotnetcore runs happily on Windows, Mac and Linux. This was developed and tested locally on Ubuntu.

Most of what you see is the Microsoft app template, have a look in [hello-goose/Pages] for the custom code. The image is in [hello-goose/wwwroot].

To use it, run `cf push`.
